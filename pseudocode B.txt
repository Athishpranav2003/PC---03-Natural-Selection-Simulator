This pseudocode is to make list of position of organism after every iteration

position list =[]
initial position is (x0,y0)
current position is (x,y)=(x0,y0)
radius is r
matrix is M of order n*n(indexing is from top to bottom left to right)
number of iterations completed is length(position list)

	and list cartesian distance of them from current position is distance=[]
